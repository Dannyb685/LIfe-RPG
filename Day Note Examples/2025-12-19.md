### **1. Obsidian Life RPG & Gamification**

This is the most active project. You are building a personal knowledge management system that gamifies real-life habits using Old School RuneScape mechanics.

- **Metadata Stat Sheet:** We recently refined a Dataview-compatible metadata scheme mapping specific habits to OSRS skills.
    
    - _Hitpoints:_ Health maintenance (brushing teeth, grooming).
        
    - _Dungeoneering:_ Tech skills (coding, Obsidian).
        
    - _Intellect:_ Medical training (clinical, study).
        
- **Technical Implementation:** The focus has been on using plugins like Dataview to query these stats and potentially the **Commander** plugin for UI macros to log these actions efficiently.
    

### **2. Cognitive Science & Memory Techniques**

- **Memory Palace:** You initiated a thread on constructing a memory palace. We utilized your dog, Scout, and your local geography in Westwood and the Chicago suburbs to anchor specific memories or concepts.
    

### **3. Logistics & Personal Life**

- **Commute Analysis:** We analyzed the commute from your home in Westwood to the urgent care in Santa Monica, specifically calculating times for a motorcycle versus a truck.
    
- **Gift Planning:** Earlier in the week, we brainstormed gift ideas for your girlfriend (31, Afghan descent), focusing on items that align with her interests.
    

### **4. Career & Fellowship**

- **Yale Addiction Medicine:** There was brief activity regarding your welcome materials and email signature updates for your upcoming fellowship at Yale.

### **5. The Obsidian "Hobonichi" Layout**

- **Daily Dashboard:** We worked on designing a specific daily note template that mimics the **Hobonichi Techo**aesthetic.
    
    - **Visual Structure:** This involves using CSS snippets or specific callouts to create the classic "grid" feel, separating the page into clear quadrants (Schedule, Tasks, Notes, Daily Reflection) rather than a linear list.
        
    - **Integration:** The goal was to have this visual layer sit on top of the "Life RPG" data, so the aesthetic is pleasing (like the physical planner) but the data still feeds your OSRS stat tracker.
        

### **6. Research & Street Medicine**

- **NIDA Grant Application:** We have a thread regarding the grant writing with **Dr. Armen Henderson** for Miami Street Medicine/Dade County Street Response.
    
    - **Focus:** Tailoring the narrative to emphasize "innovating care delivery" for unsheltered homeless populations.
        
- **Underserved Communities Data:** We discussed how to structure data collection (likely within your "Intellect & Research" XP bucket) to track clinical outcomes or street medicine interventions effectively.
    

### **7. Vibe Coding / "The Tool"**

- **Audio Transcription Tool:** You mentioned building a tool to transcribe audio files (referenced around Nov 30 but likely active in thought). This connects to the "Coding" skill in your Dungeoneering stat block.
