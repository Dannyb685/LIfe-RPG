Reflection: Physicianship was a big waste today. Mandatory 8 am - 4pm for nothing of value. At least I got to do some flashcards during the day and got all my class flashcards done for histo and abdominal anatomy. Mushi came over tonight and I practiced my exam on her. Only been smoking at the very end of the night.
