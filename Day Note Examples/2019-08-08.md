Reflection: First day! Orientation was surreal at first but I quickly felt the life sucked out of me. It was soooooo boring but hey, gotta get the administrative stuff out of the way. Don't think they needed us to dress in suits and ties and sit in a lecture seat for 10 hours while they told us not to cheat, what professionalism is, and that they were there to help us. I'm zen though, I can't get bored. I can't get frustrated. The security lady almost got me this morning though, she was so rude. "Don't spell your name" and all that. Lol.
