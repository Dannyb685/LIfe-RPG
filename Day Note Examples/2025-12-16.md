## Hansei
This is a test reflection to trigger the Clarity Buff. I need to write at least fifty words here. Let's see. The Zen Refactor is going well. The user seems happy with the direction. We moved from OSRS brown to a nice paper theme. The 5 Rings are Chi, Sui, Ka, Fu, Ku. I hope this is enough words. Let me add a few more just in case. Writing reflections is good for the soul. It helps cultivate the mind and spirit. Hansei is the Japanese concept of self-reflection. It is very powerful. Did I reach 50 words? I think I might have. Let's add ten more words to be absolutely safe and sure about the count.
