## Notes
- This is a pretty crazy night shift. They all seem that way. I would say the nursing tonight was much better than last night or the night before, and I was glad that I didn't have to put anyone on a hold or anything like that overnight, which is a really disturbing part of my job. The highlight of tonight was catching a likely pulmonary embolism in a cancer patient.
- Early on it began with just this patient having a low-grade fever, probably nothing, just an FYI from the nurse. But I really followed it up and followed it through, all the way to the point of needing to get a CT pulmonary angiography to evaluate for a pulmonary embolism. I had the patient at bedside, comforting them, evaluating them, counseling them, following up on tests and scans, communicating with everyone in the hospital. Real doctor shit you know. 
- I'm just feeling a lot more confident already in my decision-making and in carrying out basic workups to get things going. At the same time, it's really helpful to have my handbook as well. I'll always keep a handbook; there's no reason for me not to write things down and to ensure I'm not forgetting anything."
