# Life RPG: Sanctuary Edition
**"Cultivate your inner garden."**

A passive, theme-aware "Silent Witness" for Obsidian. Unlike traditional RPG plugins that demand manual management, Life RPG operates in the background, converting your knowledge work and daily habits into a serene, evolving Zen Garden.

## Core Philosophy
1.  **Silent Witness**: No manual data entry for the game itself. The plugin parses your existing Obsidian workflow (files, daily notes, tasks) to generate progress.
2.  **Zen Aesthetic**: Minimalist, isometric pixel art ("The Garden") replaces spreadsheets and complex HUDs.
3.  **Theme Native**: Fully respects your Obsidian theme (colors, fonts) using CSS variables. Zero "theme clash."
4.  **Automatic "Aha!"**: Writing, organizing, and completing tasks *automatically* rewards XP. No setup required to start.

## Key Features

### 1. The Garden (Dashboard)
A 64x32 isometric visualization of your mind's state. It evolves as you level up.
*   **Visuals**: Isometric pixel art that scales with your progress.
*   **Mechanic**: Passive observation. No interactive buildings or combat. It is a reflection of your work.

### 2. The Chronicle (Journal)
Your central command center for daily operations.
*   **Active Tasks**: Aggregates uncompleted checklists from your Daily Notes.
*   **Habit Tracking**: Visualizes habit progress (e.g., `Exercise`, `Meditation`) pulled directly from Daily Note frontmatter.

### 3. The 5 Rings (Focus)
A built-in Pomodoro and Focus timer.
*   **Modes**: Pomodoro, Stopwatch, Meditate.
*   **Rewards**: Completing focus sessions grants instant XP to relevant skills (e.g., "Scholar").

### 4. Automatic Progression

*   **Vault Mapping**: Map specific folders (e.g., `Projects/Coding`) or tags (`#gym`) to specific Skills to customize your growth.

## Technical Architecture

### [markdownService.ts](file:///Users/danielbergholz/Documents/Second%20Brain/00.%20Attachments/06.%20Antigravity/LIfe-RPG/services/markdownService.ts) (The Eye)
*   **Function**: Scans your vault using Obsidian's `MetadataCache`.
*   **Logic**:
    *   Detects "Daily Notes" via liberal pattern matching (`YYYY-MM-DD`, [Daily/](file:///Users/danielbergholz/Documents/Second%20Brain/00.%20Attachments/06.%20Antigravity/LIfe-RPG/types.ts#81-86) folder).
    *   Extracts frontmatter keys (`Brush_Teeth:: 2`) for habit tracking.
    *   Calculates "Effort XP" based on `file.stat.size` (capped at 500xp/file).
    *   **Performance**: Event-driven (only reparses on `metadata:changed`).

### [persistenceService.ts](file:///Users/danielbergholz/Documents/Second%20Brain/00.%20Attachments/06.%20Antigravity/LIfe-RPG/services/persistenceService.ts) (The Memory)
*   **Function**: Manages the `life-rpg-data.json` file in your vault root.
*   **Data**: Stores your custom Settings, Layout state, and History.

### [HomeBase.tsx](file:///Users/danielbergholz/Documents/Second%20Brain/00.%20Attachments/06.%20Antigravity/LIfe-RPG/components/HomeBase.tsx) (The View)
*   **Function**: Renders the Zen Garden.
*   **Tech**: React + Canvas-style div positioning. Uses a procedural noise map for terrain generation.

### [App.tsx](file:///Users/danielbergholz/Documents/Second%20Brain/00.%20Attachments/06.%20Antigravity/LIfe-RPG/App.tsx) (The Controller)
*   **Function**: The main React container mounted into the Obsidian Leaf. Handles tab switching and global state.
